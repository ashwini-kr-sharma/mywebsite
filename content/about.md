I a Scientific Investigator - Computational Biology at [GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)] (https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/). Previously, I have worked as a bioinformatics scientist at the [Health Data Science Unit](https://www.hdsu.org/), Universitätsklinikum Heidelberg, Germany.

I did my doctoral research at the [German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ)](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html) and [Hans Knöll Institute (HKI)](http://www.leibniz-hki.de/en/home.html). After my PhD, I briefly worked as a scientific associate at [The Center for Sepsis Control & Care](http://www.cscc.uniklinikum-jena.de/cscc/en/CSCC.html), Universitätsklinikum Jena.

I have a Masters degree in Genomics from the [Madurai Kamraj University](http://www.genomicsmku.org/), India and a Bachelors degree in Biotechnology from [Vellore Institute of Technology](http://www.vit.ac.in/), India.

In over 10 years as a computational biologist, my work has broadly revolved around using statistical and computational tools to understand disease causing mechanisms using genomic and epigenomic data.

# Interpersonal Skills

Most of my projects were carried out in close collaboration with experimental or clinical groups. Thus, I have the necessary experience in managing and working in multidisciplinary teams. Furthermore, my academic background was in experimental biology while my professional background is in computational biology which has made me a good intermediary who can bridge and communicate across diverse experts in interdisciplinary projects.
