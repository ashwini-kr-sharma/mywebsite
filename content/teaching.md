## Advanced training in regulatory genomics

I have taught an intensive 2-day  [ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq Bioinformatics Analysis Workshop](https://hdsu-bioquant.github.io/chipatac2020/) to PhD students (experimental biologists) from Goethe Research Academy for Early Career Researchers (GRADE), Goethe-Universit√§t Frankfurt.

## Data Analysis - Practical training

I have taught [practical sessions on Data Analysis](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/) to B.Sc Molecular Biotechnology students of University Heidelberg (2019/20)

- [Exploratory data analysis](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/practicals/1_ExploratoryDataAnalysis.html)
- [Unsupervised learning](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/practicals/2_UnsupervisedLearning.html)
- [Probability distributions](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/practicals/3_BasicStatistics-ProbabilityDistributions.html)
- [Real world example of using data analysis -  Climate change](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/practicals/0_greenfriday.html)
- [Hypothesis testing](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/practicals/4_HypothesisTests.html)
- [Regression](http://bioinfo.ipmb.uni-heidelberg.de/crg/datascience3fs/practicals/5_Regression.html)

## Data Analysis - Project based teaching

I have developed teaching materials and course contents for project based teaching of B.Sc Molecular Biotechnology students of University Heidelberg (2019/20)

- [Genetic interactions in cancer](https://github.com/ashwini-kr-sharma/01-genetic-interactions-in-cancer)
- [Cancer Hallmarks and Metabolic pathways](https://github.com/ashwini-kr-sharma/01_Cancer-Hallmarks_2020)

## Research supervision

I have experience in mentoring and supervising young researchers. I have pursued my own research ideas successfully with junior researchers as their bachelor/master thesis and internship projects. Also, I have assisted in the onboarding process of new PhDs and PostDocs helping them start their research projects and learn new techniques.
